The code is a React application that displays a navigation bar at the top of the page, an interactive map, and a set of user cards. The navigation bar allows the user to navigate to different sections of the page. The background image is also displayed on the top of the page.

The interactive map is rendered using the react-leaflet library and displays markers for different locations. The locations and names of the markers are taken from a public API and are thus different from the actual locations and names. The map also allows the user to interact with it and view different locations. An icon can be attached to the markers but it is not implemented in this example.

The user cards are rendered at the bottom of the page and display information about different users, such as their name and location. The data for the user cards is also taken from the same public API, and thus the names and locations of the users are different from real-world data.

The code also uses CSS and SCSS for styling the components, and animation styling is also used in the application. The data is fetched from the public API when the application first loads, and the application updates the state of the user cards and markers on the map accordingly.
